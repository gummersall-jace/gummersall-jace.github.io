          <h3>Brigham Young University-Idaho</h3>
          <h4>BS in Computer Information Technology - April 2018</h4>
          <h5>Rexburg, Idaho</h5>
          <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-I) gave me an opportunity to grow as an indivual, while enhancing my personal skills. I had the privelege of learning from skilled professors that challenged me to stretch and grow intellectually. My involvement working on-campus as an IT Student Tech gave me opportunities to apply what I was learning at school while on the job. BYU-I helped me discover my passions, taught me how to love learning, and created a sure foundation for me, so that as I continue on, I will not fail.
